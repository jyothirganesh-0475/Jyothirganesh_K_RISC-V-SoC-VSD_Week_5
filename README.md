# üöÄ OpenROAD Flow: From RTL to Placement

This repository documents a **complete hands-on flow using OpenROAD** ‚Äî taking a Verilog RTL design (`gcd`) all the way through **synthesis, floorplanning, and placement** using the **Sky130 HD** PDK.
It includes environment setup, troubleshooting steps, and visualization of the resulting layout using both **OpenROAD GUI** and **KLayout**.

-----

## üß† Why This Flow is Important in VLSI Journey

In **VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) design**, we transform abstract hardware concepts written in a **Hardware Description Language (HDL)** like Verilog into a **physical chip layout** that can be fabricated on silicon. This transformation is called the **RTL-to-GDSII flow**.

The backend physical design steps‚Äî**synthesis, floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis, and routing**‚Äîdirectly impact the **chip‚Äôs performance, power, and area**. By mastering these steps, designers can:

1.  **Bridge Logic and Layout:** Turn logic gates and flip-flops into a manufacturable chip structure.
2.  **Optimize Performance:** Placement and floorplanning affect critical path delays and timing.
3.  **Ensure Power Efficiency:** Proper planning of power rails and cell placement reduces IR drop and leakage.
4.  **Reduce Area:** Efficient utilization of silicon reduces cost and allows more functionality per chip.

### üß≠ Diagram Explanation

| **Phase** | **Purpose** | **Key Outputs** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| üü© Phase 1: Inputs | Collects design and PDK resources. | Verilog Netlist, Sky130 LEF/LIB files, `config.mk` |
| üü¶ Phase 2: Physical Design | OpenROAD flow executes synthesis, floorplan, and placement. | `2_floorplan.def`, `3_place.def`, `.odb` |
| üüß Phase 3: Visualization | Layouts are loaded in OpenROAD GUI / KLayout for analysis. | Verified Layout View |

### üí° Simplified View of Where This Task Fits

| Stage | What Happens |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Synthesis** | Converts your Verilog code into a gate-level netlist of standard logic cells. |
| **Floorplanning** | Defines the chip‚Äôs physical dimensions, allocates space for blocks, and plans the power grid (like creating a building blueprint). |
| **Placement** | Places thousands of standard cells within the floorplan, aiming for optimal performance and routability. |

## üñºÔ∏è Step 4: Visualizing the Layout

### 4.1 Using OpenROAD GUI

```bash
# Navigates to the root of the flow scripts directory
cd ~/OpenROAD-flow-scripts
# Sets up the environment variables
source ./env.sh
# Navigates back into the flow directory
cd flow
# Starts the OpenROAD tool in graphical user interface mode
openroad -gui
```

Open floorplan: `results/sky130hd/gcd/base/2_floorplan.odb`
Open placement: `results/sky130hd/gcd/base/3_place.odb`

### 4.2 Using KLayout

```bash
# Navigates directly to the flow directory
cd ~/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow
# Starts the OpenROAD tool in command-line (Tcl) mode
openroad
```

In OpenROAD shell:

```tcl
# Reads the base technology LEF file (physical library)
read_lef platforms/sky130hd/lef/sky130_fd_sc_hd.tlef
# Reads the merged LEF file containing all standard cells
read_lef platforms/sky130hd/lef/sky130_fd_sc_hd_merged.lef
# Loads the floorplan database file (.odb) into memory
read_db results/sky130hd/gcd/base/2_floorplan.odb
# Exports the loaded floorplan as a .def file (for KLayout)
write_def results/sky130hd/gcd/base/2_floorplan.def
# Loads the placement database file (.odb) into memory
read_db results/sky130hd/gcd/base/3_place.odb
# Exports the loaded placement as a .def file (for KLayout)
write_def results/sky130hd/gcd/base/3_place.def
# Exits the OpenROAD shell
exit
```

Open in KLayout:

```bash
# Starts KLayout, loading the .lef files as technology and opening the .def layout
klayout -l platforms/sky130hd/lef/sky130_fd_sc_hd.tlef \
        -l platforms/sky130hd/lef/sky130_fd_sc_hd_merged.lef \
        results/sky130hd/gcd/base/2_floorplan.def
```

## üßæ Results Summary

| Stage | File | Description |
